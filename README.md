Part 4: Motion Explanation
Write a short explanation answering:

Why does the animation feel smooth / aggressive / heavy?
this transition feels smooth because the transition is 0.4s–0.6s, changes happen slow, not suddenly.

Which keyframe had the biggest impact on motion?
The @keyframes pulse animation. It makes the image frame glow continuously. It keeps the motion alive even after the scan finishes.


What would break if that keyframe was removed?
The glow effect would stop. The scanner would look more basic and less futuristic.
